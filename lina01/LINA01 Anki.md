**Linguistics**

the scientific study of languages

**What does it mean to know a language?**

- To be able to **communicate** with that language
- To be able to know the difference between proper and improper **grammar**
- Knowing the **sounds** and symbols of the language and able to communicate back

(cgs)

**Competence**

Unconscious knowledge of your first language

**Performance**

When you begin to speak your language or communicate in a language

**Mental Grammar**

another name for Competence

**Components of Grammar:**

1. **P**honetics
2. **P**honology
3. **M**orphology
4. **S**yntax
5. **S**emantics

(PPMSS)

**What are the two approaches to Grammar?**

Perscriptivism and Descriptivism

**Perscriptivism**

Should and shouldn'ts of a language. 

**Descriptivism**

Describing a language's usage. 

Not adding own bias in it. 

**How do Perscriptivist separate terms?**

They separate terms into "grammatical" and "ungrammatical"

**How do Descriptivists separate terms?**

They separate terms into "standard" and "non-standard" forms. 

**What are the Perscriptivist Arguements?**

1. Injunction against the use of **f**oreign words
2. One form is more **l**ogical than another
3. A preference for **o**lder forms of the language
4. An appeal to **c**lassical forms

(floc)

**What are the Descriptivist Arguements?**

1. All forms of a language are **v**alid
2. No strong reason for one to **m**atch another
3. Languages are all **c**hanging in subtle ways
4. Languages all have **a**dopted words from other sources

(vmca)

**What are the 5 Characteristics of Grammar?**

1. Generality
2. Inaccessibility
3. Mutability
4. Parity
5. Universality

**Generality**

all languages/dioalects (and speakers/signers) have a grammar

individual grammatical systems differ in the use of structure formation rules

**Parity**

all grammars are equal

**Mutability**

Grammars change over time

**Inaccessibility**

grammatical knowledge is unconscious

it cannot be figured out just by thinking about it

**Universality**

all grammars are alike in basic ways

all grammars share an inventory of principles and properties

**What is the inventory of principles and propties called that all languages share?**

universals

## LEC 2

**What is it meant when we say that language is creative?**

humans have the ability to produce and understand an infinite range of sentences

**Where do we store sounds from which we create words?**

Mental Lexicon

**What is specifically stored in our mental lexicon?**

words and informations about those words

**Forms**

Sounds, words, and signs to which meanings are attached

It is arbitrary, it is not iconic

**Phonology**

the study of how sounds (phonemes) combine

**Morphology**

the analysis of the structure of words

The study of the structure of words and the component of grammar that includes the rules of word formation

**Words**

In linguistics, the smallest free form in language

**Free Form**

An element that does not have to occur in a fixed position with respect to neighbouring elements

**Linguistical Word**

If it can occur in isolation

and at different positions in the sentence

**Word Properties**

Words are not structured

Words are not the smallest units of meaning

**Morpheme**

the smallest unit of meaning

arbitrary union of sound and meaning

**Complex Words**

words that have more that one morpheme

**Allomorphs**

morpheme variants

(e.g. an vs a, -es vs -s)

**Free Morphemes**

Morphemes that can stand alone

**Bound Morphemes**

Morphemes that cannot stand alone

must be attached to another morpheme or word

**Root**

A lexical category morpheme that cannot be analyzed into smaller parts

**Lexical Categories**

- Prepositions
- Adjectives
- Verbs
- Adverbs
- Noun

(PAVAN)

**Affixation**

The propecess by which morphemes attach to other morphemes or words

**What kind of morphemes are Affixes?**

Bound Morphemes

**Affixes**

Always bound

Do not belong to a lexical category

**Base**

The form to which an affix was added

**Types of Affixes**

- Prefixes
- Infixes
- Circumfixes
- Suffixes

(PICS)

**Prefixes**

Affix that occurs before other morphemes

**Suffixes**

Affix that follow other morphmemes

**Infixes**

Affixes that are inserted into the main morpheme

**Circumfixes**

Morphemes that are attached to a root morpheme both initially and finally

**Classes of Affixes**

- Derivational
- Inflectional

**Derivational Affixes**

These affixes attach to another morpheme or word to create a new word that has a different meaning or a different category from the base

**Inflectional Affixes**

These do not change the category of the base they attach to, but express grammatical information
