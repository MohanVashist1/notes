**Competence vs Performance**

Unconscious knowledge of your first language is called **Competence**.

When you begin to speak your language or communicate in your language, that is your **Performance** of the language.

**Mental Grammar** is another name for **Competence**.

**Components of Grammar:**

1. Phonetics
2. Phonology
3. Morphology
4. Syntax
5. Semantics

**Approaches to Grammar:**

1. Perscriptive: Should and shouldn'ts of a language. <u>Their arguments are as follows:</u>
   1. One form is more logical than another
   2. An appeal to classical forms
   3. A preference for older forms of the language
   4. Injunction against the use of foreign words
2. Descriptive: Describing a language's usage. Not adding own bias in it. They separate terms into "standard" and "non-standard" forms. <u>Their arguments are as follows:</u>
   1. All forms of a language are valid
   2. No strong reason for one to match another
   3. Languages are all changing in subtle ways
   4. Languages all have adopted words from other sources
