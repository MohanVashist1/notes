**Linguistics** - the scientific study of languages.

*What does it mean to know a language?*

- To be able to communicate with that language
- To be able to know the difference between proper and improper grammer
- Knowing the sounds and symbols of the language and able to communicate back

**Competence vs Performance**

Unconscious knowledge of your first language is called **Competence**.

When you begin to speak your language or communicate in your language, that is your **Performance** of the language.

**Mental Grammar** is another name for **Competence**.

**Components of Grammar:**

1. Phonetics
2. Phonology
3. Morphology
4. Syntax
5. Semantics

**Approaches to Grammar:**

1. Perscriptive: Should and shouldn'ts of a language. They separate terms into "grammatical" and "ungrammatical" <u>Their arguments are as follows:</u>
   1. One form is more logical than another
   2. An appeal to classical forms
   3. A preference for older forms of the language
   4. Injunction against the use of foreign words
2. Descriptive: Describing a language's usage. Not adding own bias in it. They separate terms into "standard" and "non-standard" forms. <u>Their arguments are as follows:</u>
   1. All forms of a language are valid
   2. No strong reason for one to match another
   3. Languages are all changing in subtle ways
   4. Languages all have adopted words from other sources

####  Morphology

Language is **creative**: humans have the ability to produce and understand an infinite range of sentences

In our **mental lexicon** we store sounds from which we create words

- Stored in our mental lexicon are words and informations about those words (meaning, category, etc.)

Sounds and words, as well as other signs, are **forms** to which meanings are attached

The relationship between **form-meaning** is **arbitrary**, it is not **iconic** (based on intrinsic properties)

Phonology is the study of how sounds (phonemes) combine

Yet, the phonemes do not contribute to the meaning

**Morphology** is the analysis of the structure of words

- The study of the structure of words and the component of grammar that includes the rules of word formation
- (Note: the components that words are broken down into must have meaning)

##### Words

For linguists, words are the **smallest free form** in language

A **free form**: an element that does not have to occur in a fixed position with respect to neighbouring elements

Word is a linguistical word if it can occur in isolation, and at different positions in the sentence

Word properties

- They are not structured
- They are not the smallest units of meaning

The smallest unit of meaning is called a **morpheme**

- They are a grammatical unit in which there is an arbitrary union of sound and meaning that cannot be further analyzed
- Therefore, words are formed out of morphemes

Words that have more than one morpheme are called **complex**

Morpheme variants are called **allomorphs** (e.g. **an** vs **a**, **-es** vs **-s**)

Morphemes are organized in the following ways:

- Based on whether they can stand alone or not
  - Morphemes that can stand alone are called **free morphemes**
  - Morphemes that cannot stand alone are called **bound morphemes** (must be attached to another morpheme or word)
- Based on their grammatical function

##### Internal Word Structure

Complex words have structure

- They usually contain a **root** morpheme with one or more **affixes**
- **Root**: a lexical category morpheme that cannot be analyzed into smaller parts
  - It may or may not stand alone as a word

**Lexical Categories**

- Noun
- Verbs
- Adjectives
- Prepositions
- Adverbs

**Affixation**

The propecess by with morphemes attach to other morphemes or words

Affixes are bound morphemes

**Affixes**

They do not belong to a lexical category

Are always bound

Word structure diagrams could be represented by **labeled bracketing** or **trees**

**Bases**: The form to which an affix is added

- The base can also be the root
- The base can also be larger than a root

**Root**: A single morpheme that affixes attach to

**Base**: a form to which an affix is attached

All roots are bases, but not all bases are roots

##### Types of Affixes

**Prefixes**: Affix that occurs before other morphemes

**Suffixes**: Affix that follow other morphmemes

**Infixes**: Affixes that are inserted into the main morpheme (called the **root morpheme**) of a word

**Circumfixes**: Morphemes that are attached to a root morpheme both initially and finally

##### Classes of Affixes

**Derivational Affixes**: These affixes attach to another morpheme or word to create a new word that has a different meaning or a different category from the base

**Inflectional Affixes**: These do not change the category of the base they attach to, but express grammatical information

Inflectional Morphemes typically follow Derivational Morphemes in English
